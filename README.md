## Database Setup

**IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required**

To ensure full website functionality, you must run the provided SQL setup script in your Supabase dashboard. This script creates all necessary tables, sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and populates initial sample data.

### Steps to Set Up Your Supabase Database:

1.  **Access Your Supabase Dashboard**:
    *   Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
    *   Navigate to your project (e.g., `nfostlreaihscwdocbpd`).

2.  **Open the SQL Editor**:
    *   In the left sidebar, click on "SQL Editor".
    *   Click "New query" to open a fresh editor.

3.  **Run the Database Setup Script**:
    *   Copy the entire contents of the `database-setup.sql` file from your project.
    *   Paste it into the Supabase SQL editor.
    *   Click the "Run" button to execute all commands.

4.  **Verify Setup**:
    *   Check the "Table Editor" to confirm that all tables (`services`, `testimonials`, `blog_posts`, `appointments`, `payments`, `media_gallery`, `contact_messages`) have been created.
    *   Confirm that sample data is populated in the respective tables.
    *   Ensure that RLS policies are active for all tables.
